# Sudoku-Solving-XY-Robot

Created a robot that solves a physical sudoku board. Using OpenCV, the picture is converted into a 2d array text file representing a sudoku board. A sudoku solving algorithm using recursive backtracking then solves the board. The output is then physically written onto the board.
